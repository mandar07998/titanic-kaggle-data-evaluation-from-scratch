# titanic-kaggle-data-evaluation-from-scratch
I have made some changes to code provided by "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32o0DnuRjfg&amp;list=PLTJTBoU5HOCRrTs3cJK-PbHM39cwCU0PF&amp;index=1"I am new to data science and this is my first hands-on project.
This is my documentation of my evaluation of titanic dataset available on kaggle.
I have not uploaded r script file of first 3 video lectures provided by david langer(link above)as I have done the exact same thing as he did (data visualizations using ggplot2)in the first 3 script files.
rscript files and explanation from lec 4 is provided on my repository.Any feedback is appreciated!
